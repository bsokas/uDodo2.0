# uDodo2.0

uDodo2.0 is the second attempt to implement an application that employs machine learning algorithms to inspect academic dishonesty records and use it to better predict trends in cheating and plagiarism and encourage instructors to design assignments that decreased temptation.

An ill-fated attempt was made to create the project during winter Penn Apps (January 2017), but with little knowledge of web frameworks it was difficult to get it off the ground. All code from the prior version has been scrapped for this project and will be constructed anew using Python-Django.
